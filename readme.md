# SLinux
SLinux (Sebo Linux) is an attempt to create an independent and minimalistic [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) distribution completely made from scratch. â€‹It includes self-written software like commands and shells, but it also comes with [GNU's Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). It still depends on [Busybox](https://busybox.net/) and it will for a while, but I'm trying to replace it with my own software.
