# SLinux
SLinux (Sebo Linux) is a try of creating an indepenent and minimalistic [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) distribution completely from scratch.
It includes self written software like commands and shells,
but It also comes with [GNU's Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).
It still depends on [Busybox](https://busybox.net/) and it will for a while, but I'm trying to replace it with my own software.
